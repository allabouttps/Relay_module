Relay Module

Description:
This project is a relay-based electronic switch circuit PCB designed using Proteus 8 Professional.  
The relay acts as an electromechanical switch to control high-voltage AC loads using a low-voltage DC trigger from a microcontroller or sensor module.

Components Used:
- 5V Relay
- NPN Transistor
- Diodes
- Resistor
- LED
- Power Source

Working:
When a low-voltage signal is applied to the base of the transistor, it turns ON and energizes the relay coil. This closes the switch contacts and allows current to flow to the external load. The LED glows to indicate relay activation.
